# 🧞 The 3 Genie Game

> *“Be careful what you wish for—or, better yet, be clever in how you ask.”*

## What is the 3 Genie Game?

The 3 Genie Game is a playful, paradoxical thought experiment.  
You are granted three “wishes”—but the genies in this game never answer directly.  
Instead, each wish must be shaped as a question, and each answer returns a twist, a reflection, or a paradox.

It’s a game for seekers, philosophers, therapists, friends, and anyone who finds meaning in asking *better* questions.

## How to Play

**1. The Seeker:**  
You begin the game by making three requests.  
But here’s the catch: Each “wish” must also be a question, and each question must carry an intention (past, present, or future).

**2. The Genie:**  
The genie must grant each wish—  
…but never with a simple answer.  
Instead, the genie responds with a paradox, a new perspective, or a reflection that may challenge the seeker’s original intent.

**3. Reflection:**  
After three wishes and three answers, both seeker and genie look back.  
What emerged? Was an answer found, or did the questions themselves transform you?

## Example Play

**Wish 1 (Past):**  
“I wish to know why I always forget what matters most.”  
*Genie grants:* “Granted: Each time you forget, you create space to remember something new. Memory is both loss and renewal.”

**Wish 2 (Present):**  
“I wish to see myself as I am, not as I fear.”  
*Genie grants:* “As you wish: To see yourself, you must first open your eyes to what you fear. Who you are is the one who dares to look.”

**Wish 3 (Future):**  
“I wish to know what I will become.”  
*Genie grants:* “Granted: You become the one who asks this question, again and again. The answer is always just ahead, waiting for you.”

## Why Play?

- To explore meaning when direct answers fall short.
- To deepen conversation—with yourself, with others, or in therapy.
- To find wisdom in the space between wish and question.

---

## Want to Play?

- Try it alone, in pairs, or with a group.
- Bring your own “genie” (a friend, a therapist, or even an AI).
- Explore past, present, and future—or invent your own themes.

**Remember:**  
Every wish is a question.  
Every answer is a beginning.
